# ML-task-spacesence
Train a ML model on the EuroSAT land cover classification dataset.

## Question 1:

## **I have defined two functions:**
- "load_data" loads images from a specified path, resizes them to a given size, stores them in a numpy array and labels them with integers corresponding to their respective classes. The labels are then converted to one-hot encoding. The images and labels are then randomly shuffled.

- "data_generator" defines a data generator that divides the images and labels into batches of a given size, and then iteratively returns these batches until all images and labels are exhausted.

- Then the necessary parameters are defined and the "load_data" function is called to load the images and labels from the "2750" directory and store them in "images" and "labels" variables.

## **results of the model training code:**

## Question 3:

## **Constraints of the current solution:**

- The model architecture used is relatively simple and may not be able to capture complex features in the images.
- The dataset contains only 10 classes, which may limit the diversity of the training data and the generalization ability of the model.
- The training data has not been augmented, which could have improved the model's ability to generalize to new data.
- The model has been trained for only 10 epochs, which may not be enough for the model to converge and reach its optimal performance.
- The batch size used for training is relatively small, which may slow down the training process and reduce the stability of the model during training.

## **Potential improvements to the solution:**

- Use a more complex model architecture, such as a deep residual network, to improve the model's ability to capture complex features in the images.
- Use a larger and more diverse dataset, or augment the existing dataset with techniques such as rotation, translation, and flipping, to improve the model's generalization ability.
- Train the model for more epochs, or use an early stopping strategy based on validation performance, to allow the model to converge and reach its optimal performance.
- Use a larger batch size, or use a batch size that is a multiple of the number of GPUs available, to accelerate the training process and improve the stability of the model during training.
- Use transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained model on a large and diverse dataset, such as ImageNet, to improve the model's performance on the EuroSAT dataset.
