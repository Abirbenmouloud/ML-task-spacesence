# ML-task-spacesence
Train a ML model on the EuroSAT land cover classification dataset.




##Question 3:

##**Constraints of the current solution:**

-The model architecture used is relatively simple and may not be able to capture complex features in the images.
-The dataset contains only 10 classes, which may limit the diversity of the training data and the generalization ability of the model.
-The training data has not been augmented, which could have improved the model's ability to generalize to new data.
-The model has been trained for only 10 epochs, which may not be enough for the model to converge and reach its optimal performance.
-The batch size used for training is relatively small, which may slow down the training process and reduce the stability of the model during training.

##**Potential improvements to the solution:**

-Use a more complex model architecture, such as a deep residual network, to improve the model's ability to capture complex features in the images.
-Use a larger and more diverse dataset, or augment the existing dataset with techniques such as rotation, translation, and flipping, to improve the model's generalization ability.
-Train the model for more epochs, or use an early stopping strategy based on validation performance, to allow the model to converge and reach its optimal performance.
-Use a larger batch size, or use a batch size that is a multiple of the number of GPUs available, to accelerate the training process and improve the stability of the model during training.
-Use transfer learning to fine-tune a pre-trained model on a large and diverse dataset, such as ImageNet, to improve the model's performance on the EuroSAT dataset.
